# Simulation-of-a-wind-farm
For my C programming project, I created a simulation of a wind farm. The program tracks wind turbine states (operational, new, or broken) and simulates daily operations based on wind speed. It also calculates energy production, maintenance costs, and monitors full capacity operation.
